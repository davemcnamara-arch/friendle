# Security Audit & Hardening - Complete Implementation

## Overview

Complete security audit and hardening of the Friendle app addressing 12 vulnerabilities across critical, high, and medium priority levels.

## üî¥ Critical Fixes (Session 1)

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
**Problem:** 11 core tables had missing or incomplete RLS policies
**Fix:** Comprehensive RLS policies added to all tables
- ‚úÖ `profiles` - Read all (for UI), update only own
- ‚úÖ `circles` - Read only where user is member
- ‚úÖ `circle_members` - Read all, modify only own
- ‚úÖ `activities` - Read all (public templates)
- ‚úÖ `preferences` - Read/write only own
- ‚úÖ `matches` - Read only in user's circles
- ‚úÖ `match_participants` - Manage own participation
- ‚úÖ `events` - Read/write only in user's matches
- ‚úÖ `event_participants` - Manage own RSVP
- ‚úÖ `match_messages` - Read/write only in user's matches
- ‚úÖ `event_messages` - Read/write only in user's events

**Critical Bug Fixed:** Infinite recursion in RLS policies
- **Symptom:** Users couldn't log in - "infinite recursion detected"
- **Cause:** Policies referencing same table they protected
- **Solution:** Simplified policies to avoid circular dependencies

**Files:**
- `MIGRATION_fix_recursion_complete.sql` ‚úÖ **APPLIED**
- `RLS_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

---

### 2. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Protection
**Problem:** Message content rendered as raw HTML without sanitization
**Fix:** Implemented `sanitizeHTML()` function with whitelist approach

**Features:**
- Escapes all HTML by default to prevent script injection
- Whitelists legitimate HTML:
  - Images from Supabase storage (`chat-photos` bucket)
  - Links to Google Maps (location sharing)
  - Links to Google Search (activity search)
- Applied to message content AND sender names

**Critical User Feedback Resolved:**
- User reported "jpg photo from my phone came up as a long filename"
- **Root cause:** Initial fix escaped ALL HTML including `<img>` tags
- **Solution:** Whitelist Supabase image URLs to preserve photo sharing

**Files:**
- `index.html:8619-8643` - `sanitizeHTML()` function
- `index.html:8773` - Message content sanitization
- `index.html:8774` - Sender name sanitization

---

### 3. JWT Verification on Edge Functions
**Problem:** `stay-interested` function had JWT verification disabled
**Fix:** Enabled verification and implemented proper authentication

**Changes:**
- `supabase/config.toml` - Set `verify_jwt = true`
- `supabase/functions/stay-interested/index.ts` - Validate JWT token
- Verify user can only update their own data
- Return 401 for missing/invalid tokens
- Return 403 for unauthorized updates

**Files:**
- `supabase/config.toml:11`
- `supabase/functions/stay-interested/index.ts:42-103`

---

## üü† High Priority Fixes (Session 1)

### 4. File Upload Validation
**Problem:** No validation on profile picture uploads
**Fix:** 4-layer comprehensive validation

**Validation Layers:**
1. **Extension Whitelist** - Only jpg, jpeg, png, webp allowed
2. **MIME Type Verification** - File type must match extension (prevents spoofing)
3. **Dimension Validation** - Max 4096x4096, min 10x10 pixels
4. **Image Integrity Check** - Validates file isn't corrupted

**Security Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Prevents malicious file uploads (exe, php, html disguised as images)
- ‚úÖ Prevents storage quota abuse (dimension limits)
- ‚úÖ Prevents corrupted file attacks
- ‚úÖ User-friendly error messages

**Files:**
- `index.html:3338-3396` - `uploadProfilePicture()` validation
- `FILE_UPLOAD_SECURITY.md`

---

## üü° Medium Priority Fixes (Session 2 - NEW)

### 5. localStorage Security
**Problem:** Full user profile stored in localStorage (accessible to XSS)
**Fix:** Minimized data exposure with `SecureStorage` helper

**Implementation:**
- Only stores **user ID** in localStorage (needed for auto-login)
- Moves UI data (name, avatar) to **sessionStorage** (clears on tab close)
- All other profile data stays in **memory only**
- Comprehensive `clearAll()` on logout

**Changes:**
- Created `SecureStorage` helper class (index.html:2075-2110)
- Replaced 16 `localStorage.setItem('friendle_user')` calls
- Updated 3 logout locations to use `SecureStorage.clearAll()`
- Updated OneSignal listener to use in-memory `currentUser`

**Security Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Reduced XSS attack surface (email, preferences no longer persisted)
- ‚úÖ Session data auto-cleared when browser tab closes
- ‚úÖ Only user ID remains in localStorage (minimal exposure)

**Files:**
- `index.html:2075-2110` - `SecureStorage` helper
- `LOCALSTORAGE_SECURITY.md`

---

### 6. Message Deletion Strategy
**Problem:** Messages permanently deleted (no audit trail, breaks conversation flow)
**Fix:** Implemented soft delete with `is_deleted` flag

**Implementation:**
- Added `is_deleted BOOLEAN` and `deleted_at TIMESTAMP` to all message tables
- Updated delete function to use `UPDATE` instead of `DELETE`
- Deleted messages show `[Deleted]` in greyed-out italic text
- Edit/Delete buttons hidden for deleted messages
- Sender name and timestamp still visible
- Reactions preserved on deleted messages

**Security Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Privacy** - Message content no longer visible to anyone
- ‚úÖ **Audit Trail** - Database maintains deletion record
- ‚úÖ **GDPR Compliance** - `deleted_at` timestamp for tracking
- ‚úÖ **Data Integrity** - Conversation flow preserved, no orphaned reactions
- ‚úÖ **Reversibility** - Admin can restore accidentally deleted messages

**Migration Required:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
MIGRATION_add_soft_delete_messages.sql
```

**Files:**
- `MIGRATION_add_soft_delete_messages.sql` - Database changes
- `index.html:7823-7907` - `deleteEventMessage()` with soft delete
- `index.html:8784-8786` - Display `[Deleted]` for deleted messages
- `index.html:8898` - Hide actions for deleted messages
- `MESSAGE_DELETION_STRATEGY.md`

---

### 7. Rate Limiting
**Problem:** No protection against request flooding or abuse
**Fix:** Client-side rate limiting with sliding window algorithm

**Rate Limits:**
- **File Uploads:** 3 per minute per user
- **Message Sending:** 20 per minute per user
- **Activity Preferences:** 10 per minute per user

**Implementation:**
- Created `RateLimiter` class with sliding window algorithm
- Tracks operations per user with timestamp arrays
- Automatically removes expired timestamps
- User-friendly error messages with wait times

**Security Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **DoS Protection** - Prevents request flooding
- ‚úÖ **Storage Protection** - Limits file upload abuse
- ‚úÖ **Spam Prevention** - Stops message flooding
- ‚úÖ **Fair Usage** - Resources distributed fairly among users
- ‚úÖ **Database Protection** - Reduces excessive writes

**Limitations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Client-side only (can be bypassed by malicious users)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Per-session (limits reset on page refresh)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not cross-tab (separate tabs have separate limits)

**Future Enhancement:** Server-side rate limiting with Edge Functions or database tracking

**Files:**
- `index.html:2108-2170` - `RateLimiter` class
- `index.html:3402-3407` - File upload rate limiting
- `index.html:9021-9024` - Message sending rate limiting
- `index.html:5343-5346` - Activity preferences rate limiting
- `RATE_LIMITING.md`
