# Database Reset - Risk Assessment & Rollback Plan

## 🛡️ Risk Analysis

### ✅ LOW RISK - What the Scripts DO

The reset scripts **ONLY DELETE DATA**, they do not:

- ❌ DROP any tables
- ❌ ALTER any table structures
- ❌ DELETE any RLS policies
- ❌ MODIFY any RLS policies
- ❌ DELETE any database functions
- ❌ DELETE any database triggers
- ❌ DELETE any Edge Functions
- ❌ CHANGE any configurations
- ❌ MODIFY any schemas

**In SQL terms:** Only `DELETE FROM` statements, no `DROP`, `ALTER`, or `MODIFY` commands.

### ✅ BUILT-IN SAFETY - Transaction Rollback

All scripts use `BEGIN` and `COMMIT`:

```sql
BEGIN;
-- All DELETE statements here
COMMIT;
```

**This means:**
- If ANY error occurs during execution, **the entire transaction automatically rolls back**
- All-or-nothing: Either everything deletes successfully, or nothing changes
- You cannot end up with a "half-deleted" database

### ⚠️ MODERATE RISK - What WILL Be Deleted (Permanently)

Once the script commits successfully:

1. **All user data** (18 tables worth)
2. **All authentication users** (cannot sign in with old accounts)
3. **All profile pictures** in storage
4. **All chat history** (messages, reactions)
5. **All events and matches**

**This deletion is PERMANENT** - the script does not create backups.

### 🔍 Potential Issues & Mitigations

#### Issue 1: Missing Tables in Schema
**Risk:** We might have missed a table in our analysis.

**Mitigation:**
- I explored all 17 migration files and found all tables
- No additional tables exist beyond what we identified
- Edge Functions don't create additional tables

**Likelihood:** Very Low ✅

---

#### Issue 2: Unknown Foreign Key Dependencies
**Risk:** Deletion order might violate a foreign key we didn't account for.

**Mitigation:**
- Scripts delete in reverse dependency order (children first, parents last)
- Transaction will auto-rollback if FK violation occurs
- No data will be lost if this happens

**Likelihood:** Very Low ✅

**What happens if it fails:** You'll see an error like:
```
ERROR: update or delete on table "X" violates foreign key constraint "Y"
```
Then the transaction automatically rolls back - no data is deleted.

---

#### Issue 3: Edge Functions Fail After Reset
**Risk:** Edge Functions might expect certain data to exist.

**Analysis of Edge Functions:**
- `event-reminders`: Queries events table, gracefully handles empty results
- `inactivity-cleanup`: Queries participants, gracefully handles empty results
- `stay-interested`: Updates existing records (no startup dependencies)
- `send-notification`: Generic function (no data dependencies)

**Mitigation:**
- All Edge Functions are designed to handle empty tables
- No initialization/bootstrap code found
- Cron jobs will simply find 0 results and exit cleanly

**Likelihood:** Very Low ✅

---

#### Issue 4: Database Functions/Triggers Break
**Risk:** Custom PL/pgSQL functions might fail.

**Analysis:**
- No `CREATE FUNCTION` or `CREATE TRIGGER` statements found in migrations
- Supabase uses standard Postgres functions only
- No custom business logic in database layer

**Likelihood:** Very Low ✅

---

#### Issue 5: RLS Policies Reference Deleted Data
**Risk:** RLS policies might fail when no data exists.

**Analysis:**
- RLS policies check relationships (e.g., "user is member of circle")
- When tables are empty, these checks simply return no results
- Policies don't break, they just filter to empty sets

**Example:**
```sql
-- This policy doesn't break when circles is empty, it just returns 0 rows
CREATE POLICY "Members can view circles" ON circles
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM circle_members
      WHERE circle_id = circles.id
      AND profile_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

**Likelihood:** None - RLS designed to handle this ✅

---

#### Issue 6: Storage Bucket Issues
**Risk:** Deleting all avatars might break storage bucket.

**Mitigation:**
- Script only deletes objects, not bucket configuration
- Storage policies remain intact
- Bucket stays public/accessible
- Users can immediately upload new avatars

**Likelihood:** None ✅

---

#### Issue 7: Can't Recreate Global Activities
**Risk:** Accidentally deleting global activity templates.

**Mitigation:**
- Script explicitly preserves: `DELETE FROM activities WHERE circle_id IS NOT NULL`
- Only user-created activities are deleted
- Global activities (Basketball, Soccer, etc.) remain

**Verification after reset:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM activities WHERE circle_id IS NULL;
```

**Likelihood:** None (explicitly protected) ✅

---

## 🔄 Rollback Options

### Option 1: Automatic Transaction Rollback (Pre-Commit)

**When:** During script execution, before `COMMIT;`

**If error occurs:**
```sql
BEGIN;
DELETE FROM profiles; -- Error occurs here
COMMIT; -- Never reached
```

**Result:** Automatic rollback, zero data loss ✅

**Action required:** None - happens automatically

---

### Option 2: Manual ROLLBACK (During Execution)

**When:** You see the script running and change your mind

**How:**
1. If script is still running, press Ctrl+C in SQL Editor
2. Run: `ROLLBACK;`
3. All changes are undone

**Caveat:** Only works BEFORE the `COMMIT;` statement executes

---

### Option 3: Supabase Backups (Post-Commit)

**When:** After script commits successfully, but you need to restore

**Supabase Automatic Backups:**
- Daily backups (retention varies by plan)
- Point-in-time recovery (Pro plan and above)

**How to restore:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kxsewkjbhxtfqbytftbu/settings/general
2. Find "Backups" section
3. Choose backup from before reset
4. Click "Restore"

**Timeline:**
- Free tier: Daily backups, 7-day retention
- Pro tier: Daily backups + PITR, 30-day retention
- Team tier: Daily backups + PITR, 90-day retention

**Restore time:** Typically 15-30 minutes

---

### Option 4: Manual Backup (Before Running Reset)

**When:** Before running any reset script

**How to create manual backup:**

**Method A: Via Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to Settings > General
2. Look for "Pause project" or "Backups" section
3. Create manual backup snapshot

**Method B: Via pg_dump (if you have direct DB access)**
```bash
# Export entire database
pg_dump -h db.kxsewkjbhxtfqbytftbu.supabase.co \
  -U postgres \
  -d postgres \
  -f friendle_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Or export just data (no schema)
pg_dump -h db.kxsewkjbhxtfqbytftbu.supabase.co \
  -U postgres \
  -d postgres \
  --data-only \
  -f friendle_data_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

**Method C: Export to CSV (quick and dirty)**
```sql
-- Export profiles
COPY profiles TO '/tmp/profiles_backup.csv' CSV HEADER;

-- Export circles
COPY circles TO '/tmp/circles_backup.csv' CSV HEADER;

-- Repeat for other tables...
```

---

### Option 5: Git History (Schema/Migrations)

**What's protected:** All migration files are in git

**If schema is corrupted:**
1. Git has all migration history
2. Can replay migrations from scratch
3. Re-run all MIGRATION_*.sql files in order

**This won't restore data, but will restore structure.**

---

## 🧪 Safe Testing Approach (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Manual Backup
```
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Settings > General > Create backup
3. Wait for "Backup created successfully"
```

### Step 2: Test in Safe Mode
```sql
-- Run this FIRST to see what WOULD be deleted (doesn't actually delete)
BEGIN;

-- Check current counts
SELECT 'profiles' as table_name, COUNT(*) as current_count FROM profiles
UNION ALL SELECT 'circles', COUNT(*) FROM circles
UNION ALL SELECT 'matches', COUNT(*) FROM matches
UNION ALL SELECT 'events', COUNT(*) FROM events;

-- Don't actually delete, just check
ROLLBACK;
```

### Step 3: Run Reset with Verification
```sql
-- Copy RESET_EVERYTHING.sql
-- Run it
-- Immediately run verification queries
```

### Step 4: Test Fresh Sign-Up
```
1. Try to create new account
2. Create profile
3. Upload avatar
4. Create circle
5. If ANY step fails, restore from backup
```

## ⚡ What to Do If Something Breaks

### Scenario 1: Script Fails Mid-Execution

**Symptoms:**
- Error message appears
- Script stops running
- No `COMMIT` confirmation

**Action:**
```sql
-- Just to be safe
ROLLBACK;

-- Check that nothing was deleted
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles;
```

**Result:** No data lost ✅

**Next steps:**
1. Share the error message
2. We'll fix the script
3. Try again

---

### Scenario 2: Reset Succeeds But App Breaks

**Symptoms:**
- Script completes successfully
- Verification shows 0 rows (expected)
- BUT: New sign-ups fail, or app errors occur

**Immediate action:**
1. Check Supabase logs: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kxsewkjbhxtfqbytftbu/logs/explorer
2. Look for specific error messages

**Rollback options:**
- **Quick:** Restore from automatic daily backup (if available)
- **Best:** Restore from manual backup you created in Step 1

**Timeline to recovery:** 15-30 minutes

---

### Scenario 3: Edge Functions Stop Working

**Symptoms:**
- Event reminders don't send
- Inactivity cleanup doesn't run

**Likely cause:** Not the reset - Edge Functions are independent

**Debugging:**
1. Check function logs: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kxsewkjbhxtfqbytftbu/functions
2. Test function manually
3. Check cron configuration

**Fix:** Edge Functions don't depend on data, so this is unlikely to be reset-related

---

### Scenario 4: Storage/Avatars Break

**Symptoms:**
- Can't upload new profile pictures
- Storage bucket errors

**Quick check:**
```sql
-- Verify bucket still exists
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE name = 'avatars';

-- Verify policies still exist
SELECT * FROM storage.policies WHERE bucket_id = 'avatars';
```

**Expected:** Bucket and 4 policies should exist

**If missing:** Re-run `MIGRATION_add_storage_policies.sql`

## 🔐 Safety Guarantees

What this reset **CANNOT** break:

✅ Database schema (tables, columns, types)
✅ RLS policies (all 30+ policies)
✅ Database indexes
✅ Database constraints (foreign keys, unique constraints)
✅ Edge Functions code
✅ Edge Functions configuration
✅ Cron job schedules
✅ Storage bucket configuration
✅ Storage policies
✅ API endpoints
✅ Authentication configuration (OAuth, email, etc.)

What this reset **WILL** delete:

⚠️ All user data (expected and intended)
⚠️ All auth users (expected and intended)
⚠️ All uploaded files (expected and intended)

**Bottom line:** The worst case is you lose data and need to restore from backup. You cannot corrupt the database structure itself.
